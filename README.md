# Medical-images-compression
## As we know, There 2 types of compression:
### a) Lossy compression : which loses data and can't return it back.
### b) loseless compression : which doesn't lose data and can return most or all data back after decoding, this type including Huffmann algorithm.
## Huffmann algorithm is used here as a main part in my project, as for medical images, I don't need to lose data after decoding. 
## So i made a Gui using qtcreator and C++, which get images and using huffmann the are encoded to binaries, then when you need to return them back, Just with few steps in our Gui you can return them back.
### in the next pictures you will see images for the running Gui, in different steps.
### First, when you open this gui you will see 2 buttons that make you decide if you need to encode or decode.
### then, after press encoding button, a form is showed up to put your images and select the paths of required synth. files, after compression, the compression ratio will appears to you.
